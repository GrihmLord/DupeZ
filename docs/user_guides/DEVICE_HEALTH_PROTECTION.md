    # Automatically checks device health before blocking
    # Prevents blocking unhealthy devices
    # Monitors health after operation
    pass

@protect_device_health
def safe_unblock_device(ip_address: str) -> bool:
    # Automatically checks device health before unblocking
    # Ensures safe unblocking procedures
    # Monitors health after operation
    pass

@protect_device_health
def safe_scan_device(ip_address: str) -> Dict:
    # Automatically checks device health before scanning
    # Prevents scanning unhealthy devices
    # Monitors health after operation
    pass
```

### **Pre-Operation Checks**
