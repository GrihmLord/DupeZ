# Account Deletion Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that when selecting an account to delete, the selection wasn't working properly. The delete button wasn't functioning as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The main problem was in the `delete_account` method in `app/gui/dayz_account_tracker.py`. There were two critical bugs:

1. **Line 530**: `account_manager.remove_account(self.current_account['account'])` - This tried to access `self.current_account['account']` after `self.current_account` had been set to `None` on line 527.

2. **Line 532**: `log_info(f"[SUCCESS] Deleted account: {self.current_account['account']}")` - Same issue, trying to access `self.current_account['account']` after it's been set to `None`.

### Secondary Issues
- The account selection logic could be more robust with better error handling
- Missing debug logging to help identify selection issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Delete Account Method
**File**: `app/gui/dayz_account_tracker.py`
**Method**: `delete_account()`

**Changes Made**:
- Store account information before deletion to prevent accessing cleared data
- Use stored account name and ID throughout the deletion process
- Added comprehensive debug logging

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before (buggy):
if reply == QMessageBox.StandardButton.Yes:
    # Remove from list
    self.accounts = [acc for acc in self.accounts if acc['id'] != self.current_account['id']]
    
    # Remove from table
    self.remove_account_from_table(self.current_account['id'])
    
    # Clear current account
    self.current_account = None
    self.update_account_details()
    
    # Save accounts using persistence manager
    account_manager.remove_account(self.current_account['account'])  # ❌ BUG: current_account is None
    
    log_info(f"[SUCCESS] Deleted account: {self.current_account['account']}")  # ❌ BUG: current_account is None

# After (fixed):
if reply == QMessageBox.StandardButton.Yes:
    # Store account info before deletion
    account_to_delete = self.current_account.copy()
    account_name = account_to_delete['account']
    account_id = account_to_delete['id']
    
    # Remove from list
    self.accounts = [acc for acc in self.accounts if acc['id'] != account_id]
    
    # Remove from table
    self.remove_account_from_table(account_id)
    
    # Clear current account
    self.current_account = None
    self.update_account_details()
    
    # Save accounts using persistence manager
    account_manager.remove_account(account_name)  # ✅ Fixed: use stored account_name
    
    log_info(f"[SUCCESS] Deleted account: {account_name}")  # ✅ Fixed: use stored account_name
```

### 2. Enhanced Account Selection Logic
**File**: `app/gui/dayz_account_tracker.py`
**Method**: `on_account_selected()`

**Changes Made**:
- Added comprehensive error handling for account selection
- Added debug logging to track selection process
- Improved fallback behavior when account is not found

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before:
def on_account_selected(self):
    try:
        current_row = self.account_table.currentRow()
        if current_row >= 0 and current_row < self.account_table.rowCount():
            account_id_item = self.account_table.item(current_row, 0)
            if account_id_item:
                account_name = account_id_item.text()
                for account in self.accounts:
                    if str(account.get('account', '')) == account_name:
                        self.current_account = account
                        self.update_account_details()
                        break

# After:
def on_account_selected(self):
    try:
        current_row = self.account_table.currentRow()
        if current_row >= 0 and current_row < self.account_table.rowCount():
            account_id_item = self.account_table.item(current_row, 0)
            if account_id_item:
                account_name = account_id_item.text()
                for account in self.accounts:
                    if str(account.get('account', '')) == account_name:
                        self.current_account = account
                        self.update_account_details()
                        log_info(f"Selected account: {account_name}")  # ✅ Added debug logging
                        break
                else:
                    # Account not found in list
                    log_error(f"Account '{account_name}' not found in accounts list")
                    self.current_account = None
                    self.update_account_details()
            else:
                log_error("No account item found in selected row")
                self.current_account = None
                self.update_account_details()
        else:
            # No row selected
            self.current_account = None
            self.update_account_details()
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(f"Failed to handle account selection: {e}")
        self.current_account = None
        self.update_account_details()
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
**File**: `app/gui/dayz_account_tracker.py`
**Methods**: `delete_account()`, `create_account_panel()`

**Changes Made**:
- Added debug logging to track button clicks and account selection
- Added logging to confirm button connections

**Code Changes**:
```python
# In delete_account():
log_info("Delete account button clicked")
log_info(f"Current account: {self.current_account}")

# In create_account_panel():
log_info("Delete account button connected successfully")
```
