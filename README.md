**Note**: The executable requires Administrator privileges for firewall control.

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Launch the Application**: Run `python run.py` from the project directory
2. **Scan Network**: Click "Scan Network" or wait for auto-scan
3. **Select Device**: Click on a device in the list to select it
4. **Toggle Blocking**: Use the "Block Selected" button or right-click menu
5. **Smart Mode**: Enable intelligent automatic blocking based on traffic patterns

### LagSwitch Hotkeys
- `W` (default): Toggle blocking for selected device
- `Ctrl+S`: Scan network
- `Ctrl+Shift+S`: Quick scan
- `Ctrl+B`: Mass block all devices
- `Ctrl+U`: Mass unblock all devices
- `Ctrl+E`: Export device data
- `Ctrl+F`: Search devices
- `Ctrl+T`: Traffic analysis
- `Ctrl+N`: Network topology
- `Ctrl+P`: Plugin manager
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`: Toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl+G`: Toggle graph
- `Ctrl+C`: Clear data
- `Ctrl+Q`: Exit application
- `F1`: Show hotkeys help

### Smart Mode
Smart mode automatically detects and blocks devices based on:
- High traffic usage
- Suspicious connection patterns
- Burst traffic detection
- Connection limit violations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **AppController**: Main application logic and state management
- **AppState**: Event-driven state management with observer pattern
- **SmartModeEngine**: Intelligent traffic analysis and automatic blocking
- **DeviceScanner**: Multi-threaded network device discovery
- **FirewallBlocker**: Windows Firewall and WinDivert integration

### GUI Components
- **PulseDropDashboard**: Main application window with menu and status bar
- **DeviceList**: Enhanced device list with context menus and real-time updates
- **PacketGraph**: Real-time traffic visualization with custom drawing
- **Sidebar**: Status indicators and control panel

### Network Components
- **DeviceScanner**: Parallel network scanning with ping and ARP
- **MDNSDiscovery**: Multicast DNS device discovery
- **NetworkHelpers**: Utility functions for network operations

## 🔧 Configuration

### Settings File
Configuration is stored in `app/config/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "smart_mode": false,
  "auto_scan": true,
  "scan_interval": 300,
  "max_devices": 100,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

### Themes
The application supports both light and dark themes:
- `app/themes/dark.qss`: Dark theme
- `app/themes/light.qss`: Light theme

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'app'" Error**
- Run the application from the project root directory
- Use `python run.py` instead of `python app/main.py`

**Permission Denied Errors**
- Run the application as Administrator
- Ensure Windows Firewall is enabled

**Hotkeys Not Working**
- Install the keyboard module: `pip install keyboard`
- Run as Administrator for global hotkey support

**Device Scanning Issues**
- Check your network connection
- Ensure no antivirus is blocking the application
- Try running as Administrator

### Logs
Application logs are written to the console and can be found in the application output. Look for messages starting with timestamps like `[02:13:47]`.

## 🔒 Security

### Firewall Integration
The application uses Windows Firewall rules for device blocking:
- Creates temporary firewall rules for target devices
- Automatically removes rules when unblocking
- Falls back to WinDivert for advanced packet filtering

### Administrator Requirements
Some features require Administrator privileges:
- Firewall rule creation/removal
- Global hotkey registration
- Network interface monitoring
