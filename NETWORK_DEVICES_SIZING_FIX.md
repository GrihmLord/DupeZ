## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Layout Changes:**
```python
# Before
main_content.addWidget(left_panel, 4)  # 4/5 = 80%
main_content.addWidget(right_panel, 1)  # 1/5 = 20%

# After  
main_content.addWidget(left_panel, 3)  # 3/5 = 60%
main_content.addWidget(right_panel, 2)  # 2/5 = 40%
```

### **Column Proportions:**
```python
# Before
{
    0: 0.12,  # IP Address
    1: 0.15,  # MAC Address
    2: 0.25,  # Hostname
    3: 0.15,  # Vendor
    4: 0.12,  # Device Type
    5: 0.10,  # Interface
    6: 0.06,  # Open Ports
    7: 0.05   # Status
}

# After
{
    0: 0.15,  # IP Address (+3%)
    1: 0.18,  # MAC Address (+3%)
    2: 0.20,  # Hostname (-5%)
    3: 0.15,  # Vendor
    4: 0.12,  # Device Type
    5: 0.10,  # Interface
    6: 0.05,  # Open Ports (-1%)
    7: 0.05   # Status
}
```

### **Font Size Optimization:**
```python
# Before
base_font_size = 9
header_font_size = 10

# After
base_font_size = 8  # Reduced by 1pt
header_font_size = 9  # Reduced by 1pt
```
