## v3.0.2 — 2026-04-04

PvP preset additions and account tracker stability fixes.

### Added
- **Ghost Rush preset** — Outbound-only disruption. Enemies see you frozen at your last position while you move freely. 1200ms outbound lag + 90% drop + throttle. Designed for rushing campers behind cover.
- **Phantom Peek preset** — Lighter outbound burst for quick peeks. 600ms outbound lag + 80% drop. Peek corners, take shots, duck back before their client updates.
- **Direction-aware presets** — Both new presets use `"direction": "outbound"` to only disrupt packets you send (your position updates) while keeping inbound clean (you still see enemies in real time).
- 14 regression tests covering all v3.0.1 bug fixes (`tests/test_v301_bugs.py`).

### Fixed
- **Blocker missing import** — `log_warning` not imported in `blocker.py`, causing `NameError` on `clear_all_dupez_blocks()`.
- **Blocker method shadow** — `self.is_active` attribute shadowed the `is_active()` method in `NetworkBlocker`. Renamed attribute to `self._is_active`.
- **Socket reuse after close** — `_verify_device_exists()` in `controller.py` created one socket outside the port loop then reused it after `close()`. Moved socket creation inside the loop.
- **Hotkey crash with no IP** — `toggle_lag()` crashed when called via hotkey with no IP argument and no device selected. Now falls back to `state.selected_ip`.
- **Variable shadowing import** — `except Exception as log_error:` in `device_scan.py` shadowed the `log_error` function import. Renamed to `log_err`.
- **Account tracker duplicate input** — CSV and XLSX import appended each account to both `self.accounts` and `account_manager`, doubling entries. Now only writes to `account_manager`.
- **Signal stacking on refresh** — `itemSelectionChanged` signal reconnected on every table refresh without disconnecting the previous handler. Caused erratic selection behavior after multiple refreshes.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 3.0.2 across `main.py`, `dashboard.py` (window title, title bar, sidebar).
- Preset table in README updated with all 9 presets including Ghost Rush and Phantom Peek.
- README, CHANGELOG, and ROADMAP updated for public release.

## v3.0.1 — 2026-04-01

Production hardening pass for public community release.

### Added
- `.gitattributes` — Cross-platform line ending normalization. Binary files (DLLs, .sys, .exe, .ico) marked binary to prevent git corruption.
- Atomic file writes for `settings.json` — writes to `.tmp`, fsyncs, then `os.replace()` to prevent mid-write corruption.
- Settings resilience — `load_settings()` auto-recovers to clean defaults on corrupt/partial JSON.
- Self-contained settings dialog stylesheet (`SETTINGS_STYLE`) — immune to app-level theme changes.
- Complete QSS coverage in `dark.qss` — QSlider, QTextEdit, QDialog, QMenuBar, QMenu, QSpinBox buttons, QComboBox dropdown.
- Missing QSS rules in `light.qss` — QSpinBox, QTextEdit, QDialog.
- Full settings documentation in README — all 5 tabs with every field, default, and range.

### Changed
- Settings dialog completely rewritten — 5-tab layout (General, Network, Smart Mode, Interface, Advanced), all 28 `AppSettings` fields wired end-to-end.
- Settings dialog styled to match cyber HUD theme — glassmorphism background, cyan accents, color-coded buttons.
- `state.py` — Hardened `load_settings()` filters unknown keys, catches `JSONDecodeError`/`TypeError`, auto-regenerates on corruption.
- `state.py` — `save_settings()` uses atomic write pattern (tmp + fsync + os.replace).
- `profiles.json` — Stripped PS5/XBOX device-specific profiles, replaced with generic defaults.
- `logger.py` — Renamed `ps5_detection()` → `device_detection()`, `log_ps5_detection()` → `log_device_detection()` (backward-compat aliases kept).
- All documentation IPs replaced with RFC 5737 addresses (198.51.100.x).

### Removed
- 14,800+ lines of dead code: `development/` test suites, PS5-specific scripts and GUI (`ps5_gui.py`), launcher batch files, maintenance scripts, `strip_dead_code.ps1`.
- Dead UI controls from settings: `log_to_file_checkbox`, `interface_combo`, `custom_network_edit`.
- Unused imports from settings dialog: `QLineEdit`, `QProgressBar`, `QFileDialog`, `QColorDialog`, `QFontDialog`, `QColor`, `Dict`, `Any`.

### Fixed
- Corrupted `settings.json` — was truncated mid-write (missing closing brace, partial field). Rebuilt with clean defaults.
- Settings dialog stylesheet overwritten by theme changes — now re-applies `SETTINGS_STYLE` in `apply_theme()`, `start_rainbow_mode()`, `stop_rainbow_mode()`.
- Qt combo box feedback loops — `blockSignals()` guards prevent recursive signal firing during programmatic updates.

### Security
- Zero personal IPs, emails, debug artifacts, or secrets in tracked code.
- All example IPs use RFC 5737 documentation ranges.

- 9 redundant network modules (gaming optimizer, duping optimizer, server discovery, multi-protocol scanner, etc.)
- TipsTicker footer, stability optimizer integration, CPU monitoring timers, animation timers
- All root-level debug artifacts (crash logs, one-off scripts, enhancement blueprint)
