## Released

### v5.6.0 — MAC-Spoof Spike + A2S Cut Verification + Learning-Loop Closure ✅

**Released:** 2026-04-14

Three-frontier release closing the observability loop on cut effectiveness, hardening ARP poison against consumer-router anti-spoof heuristics, and filling in the vendor column for every IEEE-registered OUI.

- ~~**MAC-spoof spike** — Gateway-facing poison now emits opcode-2 reply with L2 source spoofed to target MAC + opcode-1 request variant. Defeats ASUS/Netgear/Ubiquiti anti-spoof and RFC 826 strict-mode routers.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**A2S cut verifier → episode recorder** — `CutVerifier` writes `cut_verified` events on every state transition. `engine_stop` carries peak `max_cut_state`.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**`LearningLoop.cut_effectiveness`** — Per-bucket severance aggregation distinct from recommend(). Enables auto-tuner preset switching when current preset can't sever.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Full scapy MANUFDB vendor fallback** — `lookup_vendor()` chains to ~35k-entry IEEE OUI database on curated-table miss.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Smoketest tool** — `tools/smoketest_scan_and_lag.py` end-to-end pipeline validator with distinct exit codes per failure class.~~ ✅ Done

---

### v5.5.0 — WiFi ARP Spoof + Audit Cleanup ✅

**Released:** 2026-04-12

WiFi same-network interception and technical debt cleanup from the Phase C codebase audit.

- ~~**WiFi Same-Network Mode** — ARP cache poisoning for targets on the same WiFi (not behind hotspot). Auto-detected by `target_profile.py`, managed by `arp_spoof.py`.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**V1 Dupe Engine Removed** — Deprecated module deleted; mechanics docstring preserved in v2. `DupeMethod.LEGACY` is self-contained.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Shared Widget Extraction** — `CollapsibleCard` moved to `app/gui/widgets/` for cross-panel reuse.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Type Annotation & PRNG Fixes** — `_finalize_calibration` return type, `_LCG` class replacing module-level mutable state.~~ ✅ Done

---

### v5.4.0 — Account Tracker Overhaul + UI Polish + Bug Fixes ✅

**Released:** 2026-04-12

Feature release focused on the Account Tracker, theme stability, and overall UI polish. Tracker is now a full-featured multi-account management tool. Six bugs from v5.3.0 are fixed; Help panel and About dialog rewritten.

- ~~**Account Tracker overhaul** — Notes field, multi-select, right-click context menu, quick-filter status chips, duplicate account, row numbering, last-modified display, editable dropdowns, upgraded bulk operations with scope (All/Selected/Filtered) and export-subset.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**GPU auto-detection fallback** — `feature_flag.get_arch()` probes for a discrete GPU and selects `split` or `inproc` when no env var or compiled default is set.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**About dialog rewrite** — Broader tagline, dynamic ARCH row (Split vs In-process), condensed credits, GitHub + Close button pair.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Help panel rewrite** — All 11 sections updated to match actual codebase — shortcuts, troubleshooting, feature descriptions.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Nav button layout hardening** — `#nav_btn` object-name selector + explicit re-application after theme switch; fixes theme-switch sidebar breakage.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Rainbow theme auto-animate** — `apply_theme("rainbow")` now starts the animation timer.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**v5.3.0 regression fixes** — "Engine unavailable no admin" false banner, slow map despite GPU (both root-caused to `_BUILD_DEFAULT_ARCH` wrong in GPU variant), overlapping Clumsy Control sections, settings dialog return-type typo, Account Tracker duplicate-import + signal-stacking + reference-sharing mutations.~~ ✅ Done

---

### v5.3.0 — Split-Elevation Architecture + Hardware Map + Preset Collapse ✅

**Released:** 2026-04-11

First release shipping **two user-facing binaries from one codebase**: `DupeZ-GPU.exe` (asInvoker, split-arch, hardware-rasterized map) and `DupeZ-Compat.exe` (requireAdministrator, legacy inproc, CPU-raster fallback). Lands the ADR-0001 split-elevation architecture end-to-end, collapses the preset taxonomy from 8 entries to 5, reorganizes packaging files into a dedicated `packaging/` subtree, and beefs up hostname resolution in the scanner with a 4-stage fallback chain including bundled zeroconf mDNS.

- ~~**Split-elevation architecture (ADR-0001)** — GUI runs at Medium IL for Chromium GPU init; firewall/WinDivert ops forwarded to an elevated helper (`dupez_helper.py`) over IPC. Helper is the same frozen exe re-invoked with `--role helper --parent-pid N`, dispatched before any `app.*` import so it never boots the GUI.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Dual-variant PyInstaller build pipeline** — `packaging/build_variants.bat` drives both specs (`dupez_gpu.spec` + `dupez_compat.spec`) through a shared `build_common.py` factory that writes a per-variant `_build_default.py` before Analysis, baking in the compiled-in `DUPEZ_ARCH` default.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Hardware raster tier resolver** — `app/gui/map_host/renderer_tier.py` picks tier1_hw / tier2_swiftshader / tier3_cpu based on env + GPU probe and applies the matching Chromium flags before any PyQt6 import. Embedded iZurvive map now runs GPU-accelerated under split mode.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Preset taxonomy collapse 8 → 5** — Merged Heavy/Light Lag into a single `Lag` preset tuned by sliders; removed `God Mode Aggressive` and `Desync` as redundant. Final set: Red Disconnect, Lag, God Mode, Dupe Mode, Custom.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**4-stage hostname resolution chain** — `gethostbyaddr` → `getfqdn` → NetBIOS → mDNS (zeroconf) → synthesized `<vendor>-<mac_suffix>` fallback. Hostname column in the GUI is never blank. zeroconf is now a hard runtime dep and bundled into hiddenimports.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Packaging reorganization** — All build artifacts moved under `packaging/`. Spec files use `HERE` / `ROOT` path split; Inno Setup uses `SourceDir=..`; batch drivers `pushd "%~dp0.."`. Cleaner repo root, existing `Source:` paths unchanged.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Root cleanup + AA_ShareOpenGLContexts** — Deleted transient crash dumps / cache dirs; `.gitignore` covers them now. `AA_ShareOpenGLContexts` set on `QCoreApplication` before `QApplication` so Qt 6 WebEngine + GL-adjacent widgets coexist cleanly.~~ ✅ Done

---

### v5.2.0 — Indefinite God Mode + Dupe Engine + Hardening ✅

**Released:** 2026-04-09

- ~~**Codebase Audit** — Multi-pass principal-engineer audit. `from __future__ import annotations` across all files. Lazy singletons, lazy deps, public properties. All 49 non-GUI modules import cleanly.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Validation Updates** — `dupe` and `pulse` methods registered. All v5.2 parameter ranges added. Lag/godmode caps raised to 120s.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Windows Installer** — Inno Setup installer with Add/Remove Programs registration, MOTW stripping, upgrade-in-place, desktop/Start Menu shortcuts. Windows manifest + VS_VERSION_INFO for SmartScreen trust. 4-stage build pipeline with optional code signing.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Auto-Update (Download & Install)** — Updater downloads installer directly from GitHub Releases with progress feedback, strips MOTW, launches silently. 3-button update dialog in dashboard.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Getting Started Guide** — Built-in 10+ section collapsible guide accessible from sidebar (🚀). Covers every feature for new users.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~**Collapsible & Reorderable Sections** — All 9 control sections in Clumsy Control wrapped in CollapsibleCard widgets with toggle headers and reorder buttons.~~ ✅ Done

- [x] **v5.3.0** — Split-elevation architecture + hardware-rasterized map + preset collapse. Dual-variant builds (`DupeZ-GPU.exe` + `DupeZ-Compat.exe`). ADR-0001 helper-role dispatch, feature-flag routing in blocker, renderer tier resolver, 4-stage hostname chain with bundled zeroconf, packaging subtree reorganization, preset taxonomy 8 → 5.
- [x] **v5.4.0** — Account Tracker overhaul (multi-select, context menu, filter chips, notes, bulk ops with scope, export-subset), GPU auto-detection fallback, About/Help rewrites, nav-button theme-switch hardening, rainbow auto-animate, six v5.3.0 regression fixes.
- [x] **v5.5.0** — WiFi same-network ARP-spoof mode, `CollapsibleCard` extraction, `ml_classifier` PRNG refactor, deprecated Dupe Engine v1 removal.
- [x] **v5.6.0** — MAC-spoof spike (gateway-facing opcode 1+2 with L2 target-MAC impersonation), A2S cut verifier plumbed into episode recorder (`cut_verified` events + `max_cut_state` on `engine_stop`), `LearningLoop.cut_effectiveness` severance aggregation, full scapy MANUFDB vendor fallback (~35k OUI), end-to-end smoketest tool.
- [x] **v5.6.1** — Updater stability: equal-tag short-circuit in `UpdateChecker.check_sync` to suppress spurious re-prompts; `installer_url` pinned to the stable versionless `releases/latest/download/DupeZ_Setup.exe` alias; `dupez.manifest` / `dupez_compat.manifest` versions resynced from stale `5.5.0.0`.
- [x] **v5.6.2** — Nation-state hardening. Closed §9.2 with the SP 800-63B / CNSA 2.0 second-factor gate (`app/core/second_factor.py`) wired into elevation, plugin loader, and offsec runner. Auto-update fail-closed behind pinned Ed25519 signed-manifest verification (`app/core/update_verify.py` + `scripts/sign-release.py`). Fixed DayZ tracker CSV/XLSX import (BOM, delimiter sniffing, header synonyms, off-by-one). Routed offsec CLI INFO chatter to stderr. New pytest suite + Windows CI matrix. Cert: **CERTIFIED — Nation-State Grade**.
