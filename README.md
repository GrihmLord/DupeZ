## Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source (Recommended for Development)

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DupeZ.git
cd DupeZ
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python -m app.main
```

**Note**: This runs the current source and reflects all latest UI optimizations.

### Option 2: Use the Executable (Recommended for Users)

#### 1. Run the Executable
- Double-click `DupeZ.exe`
- The executable includes all optimizations and doesn't require building

**Note**: The executable requires Administrator privileges for firewall control.

#### 2. Rebuild the Executable (to include latest changes)
```powershell
# Stop any running instances
taskkill /IM DupeZ.exe /F 2>$null
taskkill /IM python.exe /F 2>$null

# Clean build directories
rmdir /s /q build dist 2>$null
del DupeZ.spec 2>$null

# Install/upgrade PyInstaller
python -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller

# Build the executable
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --name DupeZ --icon app/assets/icon.ico --add-data "app/assets;app/assets" --add-data "app/config;app/config" --add-data "app/themes;app/themes" app/main.py
```

Then run:
```powershell
./dist/DupeZ/DupeZ.exe
```

## Configuration

### Settings File
Configuration is stored in `app/config/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "smart_mode": false,
  "auto_scan": true,
  "scan_interval": 300,
  "max_devices": 100,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

### Memory Optimization
Configuration for memory and storage optimization in `app/config/memory_optimization.json`:
```json
{
  "cleanup_interval": 45000,
  "monitoring_interval": 5000,
  "log_rotation_size_mb": 10,
  "max_log_files": 5
}
```

### Themes
The application supports both light and dark themes:
- `app/themes/dark.qss`: Dark theme (default)
- `app/themes/light.qss`: Light theme

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'app'" Error**
- Run the application from the project root directory
- Use `python -m app.main` instead of `python app/main.py`

**Permission Denied Errors**
- Run the application as Administrator
- Ensure Windows Firewall is enabled

**Hotkeys Not Working**
- Install the keyboard module: `pip install keyboard`
- Run as Administrator for global hotkey support

**Device Scanning Issues**
- Check your network connection
- Ensure no antivirus is blocking the application
- Try running as Administrator

**Application Crashes**
- Clear `__pycache__` directories: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory -Name "__pycache__" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`
- Ensure you have the latest code
- Run as Administrator

### Logs
Application logs are written to the console and can be found in the application output. Look for messages starting with timestamps like `[02:13:47]`.

## Security

### Firewall Integration
The application uses Windows Firewall rules for device blocking:
- Creates temporary firewall rules for target devices
- Automatically removes rules when unblocking
- Falls back to WinDivert for advanced packet filtering

### Administrator Requirements
Some features require Administrator privileges:
- Firewall rule creation/removal
- Global hotkey registration
- Network interface monitoring
